	description: `Yes, starting in XIVLauncher 6.2.0, there is a repair game function. `
		+ `To repair a broken FFXIV installation, right-click on the login button and select \`Repair Game Files\`.\n\n`
		+ `NOTE: Linux users will need to be using a prefix with Wine 7 or later. If you're on an older build,`
		+ ` please make a new prefix and migrate first.\n\n`
		+ `NOTE 2: All extra files that did not come with FFXIV will be moved to \`<gamepath>\\game\\repair_recycle\`.  `
		+ `This includes things like TexTools' mod db, GShade files and presets, graphics injectors, etc. You `
		+ `will probably need to copy/move files back out or reinstall other addons again after repairing. `
