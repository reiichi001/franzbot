	description: `Generally, no. We highly advise that you disable all plugins or launch without plugins before streaming FFXIV.\n\n`
		+ `However, there are a few ways to minimize your risks if you're going to stream anyways.\n`
		+ `1. How are you recording? Are you capturing the entire screen or using a program that can capture only gameplay? `
			+ `Choose the option to only capture gameplay via DirectX recording if possible.\n`
		+ `2. If using OBS and similar, have you enabled "Hide Game UI" or related settings?\n`
		+ `3. Are you using any other graphics injectors like Reshade, GShade, RivaTuner, or SpecialK? These can cause conflicts with the setting above.\n`
		+ `\n`
		+ `However, even with all of the above precautions, there are several plugins that modify the native game interface and cannot be hidden. `
		+ `Many plugins modify in-game user interface elements and are very good at it. You may not even realize a feature `
		+ `is not actually part of the game because of this.\n\n`
		+ `__You probably still don't want to stream with plugins enabled unless you're **absolutely** sure `
		+ `that you have nothing that modifies in-game elements as they will always show up on your stream.__`,
