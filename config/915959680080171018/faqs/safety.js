	description: `For the most part, yes, this should be safe to use. We've taken steps to `
		+ `ensure that using XIV On Mac, Dalamud, and **officially supported** `
		+ `Dalamud Plugins should not result in invalid or unexpected behavior.`
		+ `\n\nLike other game modifictions, you shouldn't talk about using it in-game and should exercise `
		+ `caution over which plugins you use. XIV On Mac and Dalamud are not designed `
		+ `for game exploitation, automation, or botting.`
		+ `\n\nTo the best of our knowledge, SE does not check for or prevent the usage of `
		+ `third party tools, but they are against the terms of service.`
		+ `\n\nPlease note that we cannot vouch for the safety of third party plugins.`
		+ `\n\nIf you'd like more information, please see the <#916158828670754887> channel and our FAQ post `
